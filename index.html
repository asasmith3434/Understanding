<h1> The Comp Sci Journey </h1>
<h1> What have I learned </h1>
<p> Originally the entire introduction of html and css posed problems for advencement and unstanding. Coming in to college and taking 
a course with no personal background is already being at a disadvantage. Many in the class have had some familiarity with computer science, 
and therefore, not over whelmed when being introduced to it. The actual fundamentals of how and what html and css are used for was confusing.
First came html, the most difficult aspect of it was knowing what all of the elements were doing to a designated website, for example; headers,
ordered lists, paragraphs, and etc.. . All of the new information was sparratic and irrelevent, however when implementing the information, and 
seeing by doing what the html was creating caused a chain reaction. Html didn't seem like random letters which would create "magic" but instead
the commands begin to make sense, and how html is a sequence of elements that tell a website how to display the information. After coming to a knowledge of html, css was not difficult to understand its description of how
html is displayed on a given website. However, the css selectors started off confusing. Where a specific selector was needed to grab a specific element
in the html. The rules for the selectors seemed jumbled and unrecognizeable when looking at the html. As time and learning went on 
the selectors seemed more understandable where key features could be grabbed from the html to tell which selector was needed, for example, 
if an element was given an identifier id=name, then the id selector would be used(.name).
