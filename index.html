<h1> The Comp Sci Journey </h1>
<h1> What have I learned </h1>
<p> Originally the entire introduction of html and css posed problems for advencement and unstanding. Coming in to college and taking 
a course with no personal background is already being at a disadvantage. Many in the class have had some familiarity with computer science, 
and therefore, not over whelmed when being introduced to it. The actual fundamentals of how and what html and css are used for was confusing.
First came html, the most difficult aspect of it was knowing what all of the elements were doing to a designated website, for example; headers,
ordered lists, paragraphs, and etc.. . All of the new information was sparratic and irrelevent, however when implementing the information, and 
seeing by doing what the html was creating caused a chain reaction. Html didn't seem like random letters which would create "magic" but instead
the commands begin to make sense, and how html is a sequence of elements that tell a website how to display the information. After coming to a knowledge of html, css was not difficult to understand its description of how
html is displayed on a given website. However, the css selectors started off confusing. Where a specific selector was needed to grab a specific element
in the html. The rules for the selectors seemed jumbled and unrecognizeable when looking at the html. As time and learning went on 
the selectors seemed more understandable where key features could be grabbed from the html to tell which selector was needed, for example, 
if an element was given an identifier id=name, then the id selector would be used(.name).

<h1> What is still Puzzling </h1>
<p>
Javascript functions are still causing a speed bump on the road to understanding. When taking notes in class and writing down the example
  codes it is a mindset that the examples are a foundation for all of the functions. However, it must be understood that the code is mearly for
  example purposes, and that the code format will change depending on the problem. This mindset of being able to recognize what needs to be done
  has yet to come. However, the javascript functions dealing with editing the html and creating elements within the html to insert information
  or data is on the verge of being understood. But the functions dealing with creating objects and arrays to push data into them is what causes the 
  confusion. Moreover, the way which a problem needs to be solved, transforming an array, is confusing because there is no set answer to solve
  the problem but little steps need to be taken to find a solusion, this is in reference to the first javascript lab.
